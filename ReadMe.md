This repository contains the code, data, and plotting scripts for the paper "Probabilistic Reconstruction of Paleodemographic Signals" by L.M. Arthur, F. Chelazzi, D. Lawrence, and M.D. Price. The paper has been submitted to the Journal of Archaeological Science. A preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05152.

The code in this repository is written in Python and uses the Pyro probabilistic programming library. Figures are generated using the matplotlib plotting library. The data used in the paper comes from Crawford and Vella, 2022 (https://doi.org/10.5334/joad.96).
